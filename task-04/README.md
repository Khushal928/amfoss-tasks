This task sharpened my brain. I enjoyed doing them though i wasted lot of time trying to figure out how to solve part-5<br>
here is how my approach is to first 4 questions<br>
[question 1](./cp1.md)<br>
[question 2](./cp2.md)<br>
[question 3](./cp3.md)<br>
[question 4](cp4.md)<br>
I could not solve 5th one!
